==========
Message TC
==========
All ThreatConnect |trade| Exchange Apps should write an exit message on successful or failed execution.  The TcEx Frameworks provides the :py:meth:`~tcex.tcex.TcEx.message_tc` method to handle writing this message.  The contents of message_tc are shown in the ThreatConnect UI and should provide a meaning message to the user.

.. Warning:: The Message TC exit message only supports up to 255 characters.  All data added after that will be truncated.

.. Hint:: A successful execution might output: ``A total of 132 Indicators were written to Acme Corp.``

.. Hint:: A failed execution might output: ``Invalid API key provided for remote service.``

**Example Exit Message**
