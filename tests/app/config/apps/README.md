# TcEx Apps

Example App configuration files broken down by App type. These example "Apps" are used in each of the App Config validation tests. More example "Apps" can be added at any time and will be automatically added to some test cases or can be directly called out in new test cases if needed.

The Apps that have "bad" in the name of the App directory are special cases that are testing update or fail scenarios. These "Apps" will be excluded from some test automatically.
