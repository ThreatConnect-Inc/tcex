DarkHotel has also maintained a capability to use hotel networks to follow and hit selected targets as they travel around the world.\r\n\r\nPast analysis has shown that the victims connecting through hotel Wi-Fi were prompted to install malware disguised as legitimate updates. To do so, DarkHotel first remotely compromised the hotel's web, admin and possibly, the back office hotel systems. This suggests that DarkHotel was aware of when the target would be checking in to their room, and what the room number was. \r\n\r\nDarkHotel also used forged and stolen certificates with 'weak' 512 bit RSA keys to make their malware appear genuine. These stolen certificates where used with a range of Flash zero-day exploits, including ones targeting vulnerabilities in Windows 8.1.",
